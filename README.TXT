Welcome to the Amazing 3-D Adventure Set CD-ROM!

This CD-ROM contains a great collection of tools and software to
help you create your own 3-D adventures. You'll find lots of
source code as well as sample games and 3-D programs that you can
run.

Some of the programs can be run right from the CD-ROM. Others
will need to be copied to your hard drive. If you try to run a program
in a certain directory on this CD-ROM and the program won't run,
you'll need to copy all of the files from the CD-ROM in that directory
to a directory on your hard drive. You'll also need to set the attributes
of all the files you copy to remove the "read-only" attribute setting.
You can remove this attribute either by using the ATTRIB dos command or
by selecting File Properties from the Windows File Manager.

Some of the programs are designed to be run from DOS and other programs
are Windows applications. The DOS programs are organized in subdirectories
starting with the ACK\DOS\ directory. The Windows programs are located
in subdirectories starting with ACK\WIN.

Many of the DOS programs require the DOS extender DOS4GW.EXE. Make sure
you have this program available in your directory path. It is provided
on the CD-ROM. The Windows programs require WinG and Win32s. Make sure
that you install this software if you don't already have it installed
on your system. (Both WinG and Win32s are supplied on the CD-ROM.)
If you are running Windows 95 or windows NT, you don't need to install
Win32s.

Many of the subdirectories provide readme files to help you run or
use the software that is provided. You should also read Appendix C
in the book for more information about using the programs on this
CD-ROM.


I hope you enjoy the world of 3-D gaming!!
