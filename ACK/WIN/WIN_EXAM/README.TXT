    Quick example of ACK3D in Windows. This example was compiled in both
BorlandC v4.0 and BorlandC v4.5 (see the different .IDE files - ackexam4.ide
indicates the v4.0 one).

    The default resource file that is loaded is called PICS.DTF and must
reside in the same directory as ACKEXAM.EXE - You can override this filename
by changing the properties of ACKEXAM.Change the command line to include a new
.DTF filename.

    Running the ACKEXAM program requires Win32s to be installed as well as
the appropriate .DLL files for BorlandC (they are different depending on v4.0
or v4.5).

    The latest compile of the .EXE in this ZIP file was done with v4.0
