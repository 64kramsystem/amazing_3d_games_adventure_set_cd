HEY! You've WON!

You repair the shuttle with all the parts you've
found and punch the ignition sequence.......

The quiet hum of the shuttle engines assures you
that everything is working. Looking out the
shuttle bay doors you see the freedom of the
stars and escape from the doomed station.

As you pilot the shuttle to safety, you turn back
and notice the red glow beginning on the station
hull. Soon the entire station is engulfed in a
comet tail of red and orange flames as it slowly
descends into the upper atmosphere of the planet.

Thank You for playing Station Escape!
