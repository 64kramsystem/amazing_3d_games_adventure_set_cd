Larry,

     Yeah I know....it's Christmas George...get a life!!!  My previous
message was hastily thrown together and did little else than let you
know that there was a problem with the map editor.  After openning 
presents, drinking some more coffee, and occassionaly thinking about
the map editor; I decided to provide you with something a little more
substantial to work with (if you have time to help that is).  

     I don't have MASM, but I am using TASM 3.0.  I've tried both compiling
everything and also everything except the measm.asm file (just in case I 
was doing something wrong with TASM) and linking to an EXE.  I encountered 
the same problem both ways.

     The problem is related to the IFF reader...at least that's where the
program goes nonlinear....if I comment LoadSmallFont() out of Medit.c then
the program loads and doesn't corrupt the smfont.bbm file (going from
7K to approx. 71K)...not surprisingly the MapEditor is useless and locks 
on exit...but at least it loads.  I've looked at the IFF code and didn't
see anywhere that a write to the file handle "pic" was occurring...so I'm 
stumped.

The files that I downloaded off of Compuserve regarding the MapEditor are 
listed below.  I'm hoping that possibly the MapEditor EXE file that was 
supplied with the AckExp and AckDemo files was compiled with a different
set.

Now for why I'm interested in alterring the MapEditor...maybe I don't need
to.....Here's what I've done so far with the kit:

     -    Built my own maps
     -    Added my own img files for walls and objects
     -    Added joystick support

So much for successes...now for my first stumble

     -    Add additional doors 

My first attempt to add doors was to place additional TYPE_WALL images 
files as items 63 and 64 in the example1.l01 file and the example1.c file, 
then recompile the example.

The MapEditor displayed them but wouldn't assign a MapCode to them (like
sliding or split)...also the MapEditor would start behaving strangely, 
displaying the wrong image files and not switching between walls, doors,
or objects....a possible sign that I had overrun an array, and a sure sign
that I definitely didn't know what I was doing.

Next, after looking at the code, I noticed in ACK3D.H that the the Xdoors
and Ydoors were coded 60 and 62 respectively and that Medit.c had ACK3D.H
listed as an Include file...sooooo, 
     
     -    I decided to make two more door codes 63 and 64 for my new X 
          and Y doors...namely DOOR_XCODE1 AND DOOR_YCODE1....I reasoned 
          that these codes would be passed to the MapEditor through 
          ACK3D.H...(I also placed the respective numbers and image files 
          in the files example1.l01 and example1.c ).

     -    I went to AckDoors.c and changed to function AckCheckOpenDoors()
          to include logic for identifying new doors as follows: 

/* Check doors along the X walls */
if (i == 1 && (ae->xGrid[xMapPosn] & 0xFF) == DOOR_XCODE1)
    {
    j = FindDoorSlot(xMapPosn,ae);
    if (j >= 0)
     {
     DoorCode = POV_XDOOR;

     LastMapPosn = ae->Door[j].mPos = xMapPosn;
     if ((int)iLastX > xPlayer)
         i = xMapPosn + 1;
     else
         LastMapPosn = i = xMapPosn - 1;

     if (ae->xGrid[xMapPosn] & DOOR_LOCKED)
         {
         ae->Door[j].mPos = -1;
         return(DoorCode | POV_DOORLOCKED);
         }

     ae->Door[j].mCode = ae->xGrid[xMapPosn];
     ae->Door[j].mCode1 = ae->xGrid[i];
     ae->Door[j].mPos1 = i;
     ae->Door[j].ColOffset = 1;
     ae->Door[j].Speed = ae->DoorSpeed;
     ae->Door[j].Type = DOOR_XCODE1;
     ae->Door[j].Flags = DOOR_OPENING;
     }
    }    
    
     The code for the YDOOR look the same except DOOR_XCODE1 was replaced by
     DOOR_YCODE1.

     I recompiled everyone...typed in "medit example1.l01" and watched the
     computer lockup....after stepping through the execution sequence of 
     the medit.exe file I found that it made it past the call for mouse 
     initialization but went bad there after...I tried to run the old/good
     medit from the output directory and noticed that it wouldn't work 
     either...then I started checking files and found that the smfont.bbm
     file was being corrupted.

Questions:

1.   Am I going about adding doors in the proper way...or have I over
     complicated the situation?  If so, please straighten me out.

2.   If I am ever able to compile the map editor...do you think it would
     be possible to add more codes in these squares( maybe they would have 
     to be cubes) to accommodate ceiling and floor image files?  If so
     do you have any suggestions?


I hope this hasn't rambled too ferociously....and I hope you can help...
thanks for reading this.
