Many of the DOS demos and utility programs have been compiled
under 32-bit Watcom. To run these programs, your computer needs
to be able to access the program DOS4GW.EXE - this is essentially
a DOS extender. You should copy this program to your hard drive.
Put it in a directory that is referenced by your PATH statement
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
