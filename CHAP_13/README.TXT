This project was created with Borland C++ 4.5 and requires TASM.  The
supplied MAKE file was generated by BC++ 4.5 but has _not_ been tested.

Before building the project, you must do two things:

	1)	generate a .LIB file for WING.DLL with Borland's IMPLIB utility.
		Place the .LIB file in a directory in the project's LIB path.  The
		.LIB provided with WinG is not compatible with Borland C++.

	2)	copy the CMACRO32.INC assembler include file into the project
		directory from the WING\SAMPLES\DOGGIE directory.  CMACRO32.INC is
		a Microsoft file that is distributed with the WinG SDK.

The final version of the WINGBMP2.ASM module is a 32-bit assembler module
that can called from a 16-bit Windows .EXE via the special cProc macros
in CMACRO32.INC.

For more information on 32-bit codes segments refer to the following articles:

Finnegan, James.  "Implementing Games for Windows(tm) Using the WinG API and
	the WaveMIX DLL."  Microsoft Systems Journal, January 1995, p. 61.

	p. 83.

Thanks to Gary Blaine (TeamB) for his assistance in assembling with
CMACRO32.INC under TASM.
