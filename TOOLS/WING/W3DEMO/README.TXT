This demo requires WinG.  It was tested with the WinG 1.0 production
release.  Try it with the beta or alpha release at your own risk.

If you're system is an ISA bus graphics system and the demo determines
that blit speeds are too slow, the output window size will be reduced.

Use the arrow keys to move around, the ESCAPE key exits the demo.  The
demo does not use the mouse or joystick.  (Hey it's just a proof of
concept!)
