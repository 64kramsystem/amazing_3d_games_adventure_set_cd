                          Definition of Shareware

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it.
If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are required to
register it (or purchase the licensed version as in the case of Paint Shop
Pro).

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and retail software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated
below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like retail
authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are
good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute
the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For example,
some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may
copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find
software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's retail or
Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you
can try before you buy. And because the overhead is lower, prices are lower
also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.


                           ASP Ombudsman Policy

This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle
works for you. If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with
an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to help. The
ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member,
but does not provide technical support for members' products. Please write to
the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-9427 or send a
CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536

                      Installing Paint Shop Pro
    Before you can use Paint Shop Pro you have to run the Paint
Shop Pro setup program from Windows so it will work properly on
your computer. You cannot just copy the files from the Paint Shop
Pro disk to your hard disk.  The files on the distribution disk
are packed in a special way to save space.  The setup program
unpacks those files and builds them on your working disk.

    1.  Make Windows' "Program Manager" the active window.

    2.  From Windows' "Program Manager", select "File", then
        select "Run". This will open the "Run" dialog box.

        Place a the Paint Shop Pro disk in your floppy drive.
        Type in the dialog box the command that will run the Paint
        Shop Pro setup program.

        If your floppy disk goes in your Drive "A", type:
            A:SETUP
        If your floppy disk goes in your Drive "B", type:
            B:SETUP

        Leave the "Run Minimized" box un-selected, and click the
        "OK" command button (or press "Enter").

    3.  After a brief moment you will be prompted by a dialog box
        to enter the desired location for Paint Shop Pro.  This is
        the location that you want your Paint Shop Pro files to be
        placed.  It will suggest a drive and directory of "C:\PSP".

        If you want the Paint Shop Pro program files installed on a
        different drive or directory, just click the pointer to the
        right of the characters you want to change, backspace over
        the ones you want to erase, then type in the new designation.

    4.  Paint Shop Pro Setup will unpack the necessary files and
        place them into your directory.  The status of the operation
        will be displayed as the setup program does this work.  If
        Paint Shop Pro came on more than one disk, during the
        unpacking of the disks you will be requested to insert the
        next disk.

    5.  You will be asked if you would like to add Paint Shop Pro
        to the program manager.
 
            Select "No" if you do not want Paint Shop Pro added
            to your program manager.

            Select "Yes"  to have the setup program automatically
            build a Paint Shop Pro icon and add it to your program
            manager.

    6.  The setup program will notify you when the installation is
        complete.
