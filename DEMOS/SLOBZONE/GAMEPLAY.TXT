Welcome to Slob Zone 3D:

Here are a few quick instructions to get you going.

	1. Grab all the trash you see, it's worth CASH. Just run over 
	   an item to pick it up. You can trade your money for weapons 
	   at any vending machine.
		Water Balloons are good and cheap
		Soap is better
		Deodorant is powerful but expensive

	2. Watch out for those crazy animals, they just hate seeing 
	   you so nice and clean. They'll start throwing disgusting
	   stuff at you unless you clean them up first. 
	   HINT: Keep moving, he who hesitates is slobbed!

	3. Pick up the colored keys, you'll need them to open locked 
	   doors.

	4. When your dirt meter rises it's time to think about cleaning 
	   off. You can use a pay shower or look around for RAINCOATS,
	   UMBRELLAS, & MOIST TOWELETTES. If you don't you'll get slobbed
	   and have to start the level over again.

	5. Save your game often, that way you can always come back.
