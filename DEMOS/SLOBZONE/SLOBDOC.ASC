80386 SX minimum, Deep River recomends a 25MHz 80486 or
better with the following elements:
CD-ROM drive
VGA Graphics
4 MB RAM minimum with 4MB free
500K of free base memory

INSTALLATION

Slob Zone is designed to run from your CD-ROM drive,
installation is quick, easyand puts the bare minimum of
files on your hard drive.Insert the Slob Zone CD-ROM disk
into your CD-ROM drive.

Type the letter of your CD-ROM drive: D:<enter>

From DOS type: Install<enter>

Do not run the install program from Windows, a DOS shell
under Windows orany other shell or menu program.There are
two sections that must be completed in order to install the
sound drivers foryour sound card. If your sound card is set
to something other than the factory setting,then have this
information available. It is important to know what kind of
sound card you have before proceeding.The first part of the
installation program installs the digital sound effects
drivers. Followthe on-screen instructions. If you have any
problems with the sound drivers and youhave a card that is a
Sound Blaster or 100% Sound Blaster compatible try selecting
theSound Blaster Clone driver.The second part (the red
screen) installs music drivers for your sound card. Again,
followthe on-screen instructions.Type the letter of your CD-
ROM drive followed by a colon.

Such as: D:<enter>

To start the game type: SLOB<enter>

To start the game without sound type: SLOB -S<enter>


TROUBLESHOOTING SOME COMMON PROBLEMS

Problem: I get a message saying I don't have enough memory
when I try to run Slob Zone.
Slob Zone needs about 550k of low DOS memory free and 4 Mb
of XMS free. Type MEM to find out your current system
configurations.  Free up more memory by unloading any
Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs or memory
resident programs that are being loaded by your CONFIG.SYS
and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.   Using a boot disk is one way to
start your system with the most free memory possible.  See
the section How To Make A Boot Disk below.

Problem: I can't load the sound drivers.
Sound configuration under DOS is one of the most difficult
aspects of PC computers. It may take several tries before
the drivers are installed correctly.  If your sound card is
set to something other than the factory setting have this
information available.  It is important to know what kind of
sound card you have before proceeding.

If you have any problems with the sound drivers and you have
a card that is a Sound Blaster or a 100% Sound Blaster
compatible try selecting the Sound Blaster CLONE driver.

Problem: I have plenty of free memory but the game keeps
crashing.
You may be loading software that is not compatible with Slob
Zone 3D.  Try removing TSRs from your CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Examples of programs that might cause
problems are EMM386 and QEMM.

Problem: Slob Zone runs on my computer but it's really slow.
Turn off floors and ceilings, just hit the "D" key. Hit "D"
again to turn them back on.




HOW TO MAKE A BOOT DISK

In some cases it may be necessary to create a separate boot
disk that you can use to start your system without loading
as many memory-resident programs (TSRs).  Follow the steps
below to create a boot disk that will be placed in the A:
drive upon booting.

1.  Insert a blank high density disk in your A: drive.  From
the DOS prompt type
     FORMAT A: /S

2. Copy your existing AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS to the A:
drive by typing:
     COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS A:
and
     COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT A:


DO NOT DELETE YOUR AUTOEXEC.BAT AND CONFIG.SYS FROM YOUR C:
DRIVE.  YOUR COMPUTER WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT THEM.


3. To alter the CONFIG.SYS file on your boot disk type:
     EDIT A:\CONFIG.SYS

4. Remove any lines that are not needed to boot your
computer for Slob Zone. It is not necessary that EMM386 or
QEMM be loaded at this time.  Remember to leave in the
drivers for your CD-ROM drive.  When done your CONFIG.SYS
file should look something like this:
     FILES=15
     BUFFERS=15
     DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
     DOS=HIGH,UMB
     SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\/P
     <INSERT YOUR CD-ROM DEVICE DRIVER HERE>

Save this file by typing:
     ALT F
     X
     Y

5. Next alter your AUTOEXEC.BAT on the boot disk.
     EDIT A:\AUTOEXEC.BAT<ENTER>

6. Clean up any unneeded programs in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  The
lines loading the mouse and CD-ROM drivers may be different
in your case. The file should look something like this:
     PATH=C:\DOS
     PROMPT $P$G
     C:\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM
     <INSERT YOUR CD-ROM DRIVER HERE>

Save this file by typing:
     ALT F
     X
     Y

7. To use your new boot disk, turn off your computer, insert
the disk in the A: drive and turn on your computer.  Your
computer will restart with the options contained in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS located on the A: drive.
