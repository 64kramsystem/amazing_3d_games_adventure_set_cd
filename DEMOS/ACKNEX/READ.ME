Latest ACKNEX/CubicSpace II raycaster toolkit demo. Screen resolution 
is 320x480 - three times the resolution of DOOM - so your pc should be 
a fast one. Run it with WRUN DEMO. Notice how the player movement changes 
if you climb stairs, jump into water, swim or dive. Use PgUp/PgDn and 
Home/End. There are three secret rooms to discover, one of them can 
only be entered underwater. Enjoy!
